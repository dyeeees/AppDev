                    Josephine sat alone on her porch, softly strumming her old guitar as the first stars began to
                    twinkle in the inky night sky. The melancholy tune drifted through the warm summer air, a
                    reflection of the heaviness in her heart. <br><br>

                    It had been a year since her husband passed, and the silence in their home was deafening.
                    But out here, under the comfort of the moonlight, Josephine could almost feel him beside
                    her again, his strong arms wrapped around her as they swayed to the music. <br><br>

                    As the final notes faded away, a shooting star streaked across the heavens. Josephine closed
                    her eyes and made a wish - for just one more dance, one more embrace, one more chance
                    to tell him everything she never had the courage to say. In that moment, she could have
                    sworn she felt a gentle kiss on her cheek.
